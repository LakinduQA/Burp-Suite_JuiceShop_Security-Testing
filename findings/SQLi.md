# SQL Injection Vulnerability (OWASP Juice Shop)

## Description
A classic **SQL Injection** flaw was identified in the `/rest/user/login` endpoint of the OWASP Juice Shop application. By injecting malicious SQL code into the login parameters, an attacker can bypass authentication controls and gain unauthorized access.

---

## Environment & Tools
- OWASP Juice Shop (local or Docker): `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop`
- Burp Suite (Community/Professional)
- Browser configured to proxy through Burp Suite (`127.0.0.1:8080`)

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch Juice Shop and ensure it's reachable at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Configure Burp Suite to intercept HTTP traffic.
3. Navigate to the **Login** page in the application.
4. In the login form, enter the SQL injection payload:
   - **Email**: `' OR 1=1--`
   - **Password**: `TestSQLi` (any value)
5. Submit the login form and let the request pass through Burp Proxy.
6. Navigate to Burp **Proxy > HTTP History** to view the intercepted request and response.
7. Observe the successful authentication response containing a valid token and admin user details.

## Impact
- Bypasses authentication, granting admin-level access without valid credentials.
- Allows full control over the application, including data exfiltration and administrative functions.
- Enables unauthorized access to sensitive user data and administrative functions.

---

## Business & Security Risk
- Violates OWASP Top 10 security standards (A03:2021 â€“ Injection).
- Could lead to complete compromise of backend databases and sensitive data.
- Poses severe reputational, regulatory, and financial risks if exploited in production.
- May result in data breaches, regulatory fines, and loss of customer trust.

---

## Remediation & Mitigation
1. Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements in all database interactions.
2. Use an ORM (e.g., Sequelize, TypeORM) to abstract SQL handling.
3. Validate and sanitize all user inputs on both client and server sides.
4. Employ web application firewalls (WAF) to detect and block malicious injection patterns.
5. Regular security code reviews and penetration testing.
